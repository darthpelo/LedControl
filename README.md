A Swift 3.0 full stack project: iOS application, web service and I/O control on a Raspberry Pi. Everything in Swift.

## 🏆 Purpose

When in the summer of 2016 I discovered that some one started to deploy a Swift version for the Raspberry Pi 2/3, I decided to realize a real full stack project: 
* A web service with Swift
* A iOS mobile application in Swift
* A software in Swift to control I/O on a Raspberry Pi

## 🔩 Components

### 1. 🤖 HW

Raspberry Pi 2, a demo board, wireds and leds.
